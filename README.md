# Supervisory-Control-and-Data-Acquisition-System
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, often abbreviated to SCADA, is an industrial standard system that handles the input and usage of data from a network of sensors andperforms real time analysis to make control decisions.  SCADA systems are often used inconjunction  with  other  systems  within  a  larger  project.   Some  classic  examples  of  largersystems  that  utilize  a  SCADA  system  include  power  plants  and  power  grid  managementsystems, motor vehicles, and automated assembly plants.  In these environments, SCADA isresponsible for managing sensors and making control decisions, some of which may influencethe  quality  of  the  product  and  the  safety  of  employees  and  the  surrounding  community.Since SCADA systems can be specifically designed for a particular customer and use, it isnecessary to further define what the customer expects
